Description: Functions for computing the Emerson et al. (2017) bounds 
    on the true sensitivity and specificity of a test method, 
    relative to an imperfect reference method; as well as the implied bounds
    on PPV and NPV. A function, bbounds(), ready for use with boot() 
    from the boot library, for obtaining the bootstrap confidence intervals 
    on the lower, upper bounds of the true sensitivity, specificity, PPV, NPV.
